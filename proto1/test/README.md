# Test hardware parts, connections on board, software parameters

* serial - output characters to serial port and measure the timing
* ir - test IR receiver to receive IR signal and print the received IR code
* mpu6050 - test MPU6050 in DMP mode. It reads data from MPU6050, measure the time taken by reading and prints YPR and Euler angle.
* motor_direction - test the direction of DC motors to check the wire connections.
